# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End

This outline a series of steps to establish and test a fully functional Express.js API using Sequelize with MySQL. To begin, one must create an environment variable file (.env) containing the necessary details such as the database name, MySQL username, and password. Following this, Sequelize and MySQL2 are to be installed, and a configuration file (config.js) is to be set up for Sequelize. The database initialization involves defining Sequelize models for categories, products, and tags, establishing associations between these models, running migrations to create the necessary database tables, and seeding the database with test data. Once the database is initialized, the Express.js application should be started, ensuring that Sequelize models are synchronized with the database. Testing procedures involve using Insomnia to verify the functionality of GET routes for categories, products, and tags, confirming that the data is displayed in a formatted JSON. Additionally, testing should cover POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to ensure the successful creation, updating, and deletion of data in the database. Following these steps should result in a well-configured API capable of handling CRUD operations effectively, with the validation process conducted through Insomnia.
